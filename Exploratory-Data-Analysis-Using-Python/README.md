You will pick a real-world dataset of your choice and apply the concepts learned in this course to perform exploratory data analysis.
Focus on documentation and presentation; ensure that you include detailed explanations wherever possible, using Markdown cells.

The dataset must contain at least 3 columns and 150 rows of data
You must ask and answer at least 5 questions about the dataset
Your submission must include at least 5 visualizations (graphs)
Your submission must include explanations using markdown cells, in addition to the code.
Your work must not be plagiarized i.e. copy-pasted for somewhere else.
Follow this step-by-step guide to work on your project.

Step 1: Select a real-world dataset
Find an interesting dataset on this page: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv
The data should be in CSV format, and should contain at least 3 columns and 150 rows
Download the dataset using the opendatasets Python library

Step 2: Perform data preparation & cleaning
Load the dataset into a data frame using Pandas
Explore the number of rows & columns, ranges of values, etc.
Handle missing, incorrect, and invalid data
Perform any additional steps (parsing dates, creating additional columns, merging multiple datasets, etc.)

Step 3: Perform exploratory analysis & visualization
Compute the mean, sum, range, and other interesting statistics for numeric columns
Explore distributions of numeric columns using histograms, etc.
Explore the relationship between columns using scatter plots, bar charts, etc.
Make a note of interesting insights from the exploratory analysis

Step 4: Ask & answer questions about the data
Ask at least 5 interesting questions about your dataset
Answer the questions either by computing the results using Numpy/Pandas or by plotting graphs using Matplotlib/Seaborn
Create new columns, merge multiple datasets, and perform grouping/aggregation wherever necessary
Wherever you're using a library function from Pandas/Numpy/Matplotlib, etc., explain briefly what it does

Step 5: Summarize your inferences & write a conclusion
Write a summary of what you've learned from the analysis
Include interesting insights and graphs from previous sections

Step 6: Make a submission & share your work
